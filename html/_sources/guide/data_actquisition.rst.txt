How to use the data acquisition pipeline
========================================

The data acquisition pipeline can be used in two ways: to acquire data from the camera and save it to a file, or simply visualize it.

Saving Car's track test data
----------------------------

To save the car's track data to a file, the following steps must be followed:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Pista/Vision/Data_acquisition/build
    ./save_camera_threads_car

Saving Motorcycles' track test data
-----------------------------------

To save the motorcycles' track data to a file, the following steps must be followed:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Pista/Vision/Data_acquisition/build
    ./save_camera_threads_motorcycle

Save all camera data
--------------------

In rare cases a user might want to save all the data from all the cameras. This can be done by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Pista/Vision/Data_acquisition/build
    ./save_camera_threads

Only Visualize data
-------------------

To only visualize the data from the cameras, the following steps must be followed:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Pista/Vision/Data_acquisition/build
    ./view_camera_threads
