Object Recognition
==================

The object recognition is made through a Recursive Convolutional Neuronal Network (RCNN). The arquitecture of the model is YoloV5M6, which can be found in the following link: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/hub/yolov5m6.yaml.

The model is taken from the repository of the authors and because of that, it is trained with the COCO dataset. 

.. note::

   As the model is hosted in PyTorch Hub a working internet connection is required to use it.

The model is trained to detect the following classes: **Person, Cyclist, Car, Motorcycle, and Heavy Car**.

The original repository of YoloV5 by Ultralytics can be found in the following link: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 .
