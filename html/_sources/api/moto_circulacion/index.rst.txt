How to run the Motorcycle's public highway test
------------------------------------------------------

To run the Motorcycle's public highway test (Moto Circulación), the following steps must be followed:

1. Open the */ansv_componente3/Vehiculos/Motocicleta_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py* file and edit the **line 23**, changing the *test_path* variable to the folder of the test to be processed.

    .. literalinclude:: /../Vehiculos/Motocicleta_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py
        :language: python
        :lines: 21-24
        :lineno-start: 21
        :linenos:
        :emphasize-lines: 2

2. Then run the command in a terminal:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python3 process_video.py


Description of the Motorcycle's public highway test algorithms
----------------------------------------------------------------

The algorithms used in the Motorcycle's public highway test are: **Lane detection, Traffic light Recognition, Object Recognition, and Dashboard visualization**. The main file of the process is located in */ansv_componente3/Vehiculos/Motocicleta_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py*.

In the *process_video.py* file, the test folder is selected and opened to know the date and time of the test.

.. literalinclude:: /../Vehiculos/Motocicleta_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 21-31
    :lineno-start: 21
    :linenos:

After opening the folder, the classes for all the algorithms are initialized.

.. literalinclude:: /../Vehiculos/Motocicleta_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 40-55
    :lineno-start: 40
    :linenos:

From the CSV of the video the proper video file is selected and opened.

.. literalinclude:: /../Vehiculos/Automovil_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 64-110
    :lineno-start: 64
    :linenos:

After opening the proper video file, the video is processed frame by frame. The frame is sent to the lane detection algorithm, the traffic light recognition algorithm, the object recognition algorithm, and the dashboard visualization algorithm. Finally, the frame is visualized and saved.

.. literalinclude:: /../Vehiculos/Automovil_circulacion/Vision/process_video.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 113-140
    :lineno-start: 113
    :linenos:




Parameters to change
--------------------

The parameters that can be changed to change the behavior of the algorithms for the vehicle (public highway) are:

1. Lane Detection
 * **Detection threshold of lane Detection** : The detection threshold dictates with what confidence will be detected the lane lines. The higher the value, the more confident the algorithm will be to detect the lane lines, but with higher value more lanes will be dismissed. The value is between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.3.
 * **Distance threshold** : The distance threshold is the distance that will be needed to detect a lane change, i.e., if the distance of the lane detected is lower than this value the algorithm will **NOT** detect a lane change. The values is given in pixels. The default value is 100.
 * **Distance from center of image**: The distance from the center of the image is the maximum distance to consider a lane line as a lane line to detect a lane change. The value is given in pixels. The default value is 100.
 * **Number of frames to maintain detected lane** : The number of frames to maintain detected lane is the number of frames that the algorithm will maintain the detected lane, even if the lane is not detected. This is done to avoid the detection of a lane change when the lane is not detected. The value is given in frames. The default value is 5.

2. Traffic Light Recognition
 * **Detection threshold of traffic lights detection** : The detection threshold dictates with what confidence will be detected the traffic lights. The higher the value, the more confident the algorithm will be to detect the traffic lights, but with higher value more traffic lights will be dismissed. The value is between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.3.

3. Object Recognition
 * **Detection threshold of object detection** : The detection threshold dictates with what confidence will be detected the objects. The higher the value, the more confident the algorithm will be to detect the objects, but with higher value more objects will be dismissed. The value is between 0 and 1. The default value is 0.6.
