Traffic Lights Recognition
==========================

Traffic light detector and classifier based on a Faster Recursive Convolutional Neural Network (FasterRCNN) pre-trained on the COCO dataset. The detector is then trained using a transfer learning approach with the LISA Traffic Light Dataset, which contains 43000 images and more than 113000 traffic lights annotations. The dataset contains seven classes: **Stop, Stop Left, Go, Go Left, Go Forward, Warning and Warning Left**.

Output format
-------------

The output CSV of the algorithm contains the following columns:

- Time: Timestamp of the image
- green: Counter of green lights detected in the frame.
- green forward: Counter of green lights detected in the frame that are pointing forward.
- green left: Counter of green lights detected in the frame that are pointing left.
- yellow: Counter of yellow lights (Warning) detected in the frame.
- yellow left: Counter of yellow lights (Warning) detected in the frame that are pointing left.
- red: Counter of red lights (Stop) detected in the frame.
- red left: Counter of red lights (Stop) detected in the frame that are pointing left.
