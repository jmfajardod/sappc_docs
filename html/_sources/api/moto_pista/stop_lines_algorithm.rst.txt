Stop Lines Algorithm
=====================

The stop line algorithm uses the **Aruco markers** located in the vehicle to check if the vehicle stops before the stop line. To check if the vehicle is stopped a Savitzky-Golay filter is used to estimate the speed of the vehicle from the position of markers.

.. note:: The Savitzky-Golay filter used to obtain the velocity is not as accurate as a GPS reading and **it is preferred to use the GPS readings when available to know if the vehicle is stopped or not**.

The parameters related to the Aruco markers are the shown in the following excerpt of file:

.. literalinclude:: /../Pista/Vision/Motorcycle_algorithms/stop_lines/stop_lines_functions.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 13-17
    :lineno-start: 13
    :linenos:

.. note:: If the size or ID of the Aruco markers are changed, the parameters must be updated.

The parameters related to the **stop lines** are the shown in the following excerpt of file. The **LINE_STOP** parameter is the line that the vehicle must stop before. The **AREA_ALLOWED** parameter is the area where the markers of the vehicle are allowed to be, to consider a valid stop.

.. literalinclude:: /../Pista/Vision/Motorcycle_algorithms/stop_lines/stop_lines_functions.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 21-80
    :lineno-start: 21
    :linenos:

.. note:: If the  **Stop lines** or the **camera position** are changed, the **parameters must be updated**.

Output format
-------------

The output CSV of the algorithm contains the following columns:

- Time: timestamp of the frame.
- In area: Variable that indicates if the vehicle is before the stop line.
- Pos X: X position of the vehicle.
- Pos Y: Y position of the vehicle.
- Ori Yaw: Yaw orientation of the vehicle.
- Vel X: X velocity of the vehicle.
- Vel Y: Y velocity of the vehicle.
- Abs Vel: Absolute velocity of the vehicle.
- Stopped before line: Variable that indicates if the vehicle is stopped before the stop line. **True** if the vehicle has stopped before the stop line, **False** otherwise.
