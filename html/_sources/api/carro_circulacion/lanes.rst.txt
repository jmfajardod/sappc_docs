Lane Detection
=================

Class to detect lane lines in an image. It is based on the Conditional Lane detection () algorithm described in the paper "CondLaneNet: a Top-to-down Lane Detection Framework Based on Conditional Convolution" by Liu et al. 2021. 

Repository of CondLaneNet: https://github.com/aliyun/conditional-lane-detection

Original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05003

Trained model is available at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HyLVlxXkitr3-JS_CJDVk1EKiOkt9k6p/view?usp=sharing

Output format
-------------

The output CSV of the algorithm contains the following columns:

- Time: Timestamp of the image
- Lane distance: Distance from the closest lane to the center of the image (In pixels)
- Lane change: If the vehicle is changing lanes (Given in a boolean format)
- Lane change direction: Direction of the lane change
