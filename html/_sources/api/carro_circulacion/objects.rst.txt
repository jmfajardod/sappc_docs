Object Recognition
==================

The object recognition is made through a Recursive Convolutional Neuronal Network (RCNN). The arquitecture of the model is YoloV5M6, which can be found in the following link: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/models/hub/yolov5m6.yaml.

The model is taken from the repository of the authors and because of that, it is trained with the COCO dataset. 

.. note::

   As the model is hosted in PyTorch Hub a working internet connection is required to use it.

The model is trained to detect the following classes: **Person, Cyclist, Car, Motorcycle, and Heavy Car**.

The original repository of YoloV5 by Ultralytics can be found in the following link: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5 .

Output format
-------------

The output CSV of the algorithm contains the following columns:

- Time: Timestamp of the frame.
- Object upfront: Type of object detected in front of the vehicle. The possible values are: (1) Person, (2) Cyclist, (3) Car, (4) Motorcycle, (5) Heavy Car.
- Persons: Counter of the number of persons detected in the frame.
- Cyclists: Counter of the number of cyclists detected in the frame.
- Cars: Counter of the number of cars detected in the frame.
- Motorcycles: Counter of the number of motorcycles detected in the frame.
- Heavy Cars: Counter of the number of heavy cars detected in the frame.
- Traffic Light: Type of traffic light detected in the frame. **Discard this result and instead use the traffic light recognition algorithm**.
