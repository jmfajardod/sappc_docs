Traffic Lights Recognition
==========================

Traffic light detector and classifier based on a Faster Recursive Convolutional Neural Network (FasterRCNN) pre-trained on the COCO dataset. The detector is then trained using a transfer learning approach with the LISA Traffic Light Dataset, which contains 43000 images and more than 113000 traffic lights annotations. The dataset contains six classes: **Stop, Stop Left, Go, Go Left, Warning and Warning Left**.
