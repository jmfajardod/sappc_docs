Ramp Algorithm
==================

The ramp algorithm estimates the position and angle of the vehicle with respect to the camera using **Aruco markers**. The algorithm uses the Savitzky-Golay filter to estimate the velocity of the vehicle and know if the vehicle is stopped or not.

.. note:: The Savitzky-Golay filter used to obtain the velocity is not as accurate as a GPS reading and **it is preferred to use the GPS readings when available to know if the vehicle is stopped or not**.

The parameters related to the Aruco markers are the shown in the following excerpt of file:

.. literalinclude:: /../Pista/Vision/Car_algorithms/ramp/ramp_algorithms.py
    :language: python
    :lines: 13-17
    :lineno-start: 13
    :linenos:

.. note:: If the size or ID of the Aruco markers are changed, the parameters must be updated.

Output format
-------------

The output CSV of the algorithm contains the following columns:

- Time: timestamp of the frame
- **Pos X**: X position of the vehicle with respect to the camera. **The X position is the one in the direction of the ramp, i.e., the one direction in which the vehicle should not go backwards more that the maximum allowed distance**.
- Pos Y: Y position of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Pos Z: Z position of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Ori roll: Roll angle of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Ori pitch: Pitch angle of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Ori yaw: Yaw angle of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Vel X: X velocity of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Vel Y: Y velocity of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Vel Z: Z velocity of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Abs Vel: Absolute velocity of the vehicle with respect to the camera
- Stopped: Boolean indicating if the vehicle is stopped or not
